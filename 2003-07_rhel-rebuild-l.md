rebuilding and installing a Linux system based on the SRPMS of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux."

Lance Davis [starts][1] the first thread on rhel-rebuild-l.

Lance Davis [suggests][2] creating a "redhell" sourceforge project to host the
debranded rpms.

Michael Redinger thinks this name is too similar to "Red Hat" for the trademark
policy, and [suggests][3] FELL or SEP Linux.

> Maybe "Free Enterprise Level Linux" (FELL) :)
> My personal favorite is still "SEP Linux".

Lance Davis requests REPEL (re-packaged enterprise linux) on sourceforge.  He
mentions that he likes the SEP Linux name, but poses an [interesting
question][4]:

> I like it, but I dont think its a distro in its own right - or is it ???
