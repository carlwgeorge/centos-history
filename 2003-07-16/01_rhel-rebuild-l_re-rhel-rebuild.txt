During discussion of debranding on rhel-rebuild-l, Lance Davis suggests
creating a "redhell" sourceforge project to host the debranded rpms.

Michael Redinger thinks this name is too similar to "Red Hat" for the
trademark policy, and suggests FELL or SEP Linux.

Lance Davis requests REPEL (re-packaged enterprise linux) on sourceforge.
He mentions that he likes the SEP Linux name, but poses an interesting
question:
