Michael K. Johnson [announces][0] the merger of Red Hat Linux and the Fedora
Linux Project into the Fedora Project.

Havoc Pennington [says][1] that conceptually RHL split into Fedora and RHEL,
but admits that isn't historically accurate.

> I would say more accurately, RHL forked into Fedora Project on one side
> and RHEL on the other. (Not that it happened that way historically
> speaking, but conceptually speaking that's the situation.)
